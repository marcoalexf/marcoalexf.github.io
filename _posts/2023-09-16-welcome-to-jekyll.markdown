Today I started the journey on Cyber Security. To be more precise, on Threat Hunting.
I've got a few resources to check:

Especially interested in malware analysis, but lets focus on some basics before. Previous experience (~5 years) as a Software Developer/Engineer will quickstart the process.

Totally new so will post some updates along the way.
